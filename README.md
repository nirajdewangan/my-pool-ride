# Problem Statement
## Lack of options to travel between two major cities. People have almost no other options left besides train and flight just to attend any event or meeting.
# Solution
We came with the solution for this problem statement as :-
 
There will be two person 
- Raiser 
- Responder
## Raiser
### Someone who is offering a ride to anyone between his current location and destination untill his vehicle is fully occupied or unless he closes his offerring
## Responder
### Users who are seeking for the pool/lift to attend event, meetings, parties, casualitites, etc. They will asked to fill their destination. Only those raiser will be available for whom the responders' destination must be the subset of the  raisers' travelling route.
